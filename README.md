# claw: Clojure All-in-one Webstack

## Work-in-progress. Please get in touch if you'd like to help!

Claw is a full stack, monolithic web framework for Clojure. Out of the box, it provides everything you need to build a web application, from durable storage to JavaScript.

Sometimes, you want to assemble a custom stack from components. Other times, you just want to get something up and running with reasonable defaults. Claw is for those times.
